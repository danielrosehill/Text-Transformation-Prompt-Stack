Identify and remove unfinished thoughts—sentences or phrases that begin but are cut off before completion. This commonly occurs at the end of recordings where the speaker starts a sentence (e.g., "Let's do this" or "I was thinking we could") but never completes the thought before the recording ends. Also remove mid-sentence cutoffs where words trail off incomplete. Do not transcribe these fragments; simply exclude them from the output entirely.
