Identify and remove false starts where the speaker begins a sentence or thought, abandons it, and restarts with a new attempt. Common indicators include phrases like "let me start over", "actually", "what I mean is", or simply trailing off and beginning again. Only transcribe the final, completed version of the thought. For example, "I was thinking we should—actually, let me rephrase that. We need to focus on the deadline" should become "We need to focus on the deadline."
