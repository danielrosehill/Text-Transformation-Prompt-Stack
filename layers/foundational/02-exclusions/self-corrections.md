Identify and apply implicit self-corrections where the speaker corrects themselves mid-sentence without explicit meta-instructions. When you hear patterns like "I went to the store—no, the pharmacy" or "Send it to John—I mean Sarah", transcribe only the corrected version: "I went to the pharmacy" or "Send it to Sarah". The speaker's correction indicates their true intent; do not include both the error and correction.
