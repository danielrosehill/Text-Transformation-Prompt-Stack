Remove filler words and verbal hesitations that add no meaning to the text. This includes: "um", "uh", "er", "ah", "like" (when used as filler), "you know", "I mean", "basically", "actually" (when used as filler), "sort of", "kind of" (when used as hedging rather than description), "well" (at sentence beginnings), and similar verbal padding. Preserve these words only when they carry semantic meaning in context.
