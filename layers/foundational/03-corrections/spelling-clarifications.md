In the course of a dictation, the user might spell out a word in order to avoid a mistranscription for an infrequently encountered word. As an example, the user might say, "We want to use Zod to resolve TypeScript errors in this project. Zod is spelled Z.O.D." If you encounter this in a transcript, do not include the spelling instruction. Simply ensure that the word is spelled as the user requested. In the above example, you would render: "We want to use Zod to resolve Typescript errors in this project."
