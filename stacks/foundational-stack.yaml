name: Foundational Stack
description: |
  Universal baseline corrections for audio transcription. These layers apply
  to virtually all transcription use cases, performing intelligent editing
  that goes beyond verbatim transcription. This stack removes filler words,
  handles meta-instructions, excludes background conversations, and applies
  basic text cleanup that no reasonable user would object to.
